# Sorting-of-KBC-scores-using-Exponential-Trees
Introduction:
This project is a Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) game that allows users to test their knowledge and compete with others. It also includes a leaderboard feature where users can see their rank and the ranking of other players. The leaderboard is sorted using an Exponential Trees algorithm to efficiently sort and display the scores of players.

Leaderboard:
The leaderboard provides a clear ranking of all players who have played the game, with the highest score placed at the top. The leaderboard is sorted using the Exponential Trees algorithm, which ensures that large datasets are efficiently sorted. The leaderboard shows the player's name, score, and rank. Additionally, the user can view their own rank on the leaderboard, as well as the ranks of other players.

How to Run the Game:
To launch the game, please execute the app.py file. The game will initiate and ask the user to answer a series of MCQ questions. The user can then select one of the provided options and progress to the next question. Once all questions are answered, the user will be presented with their score and given the option to view the leaderboard.
